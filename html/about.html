In addition to my studies, I have worked as a teaching assistant for multiple courses. I have also held the position of Chair within the student delegation of the AI programme committee for the 2020-2021 academic year.<br><br>
                           I have been active in the international comedy scene within Groningen. I am currently a member of Stranger Things Have Happened, prior to that I was in the group Friends of Mine. I was a founding member of the standup comedy group No Restrictions and performed with them throughout 2018 and 2019.

                        I have been a member of the Improvised Comedy group Stranger Things Have Happened since mid-2019. We put on live shows and workshops. During COVID times we have switched to online shows, performing a weekly radio show throughout the summer of 2020. We have more open shows planned for the coming months.

                        You can find me on GitHub. I mostly work in Java and C++, however I have also done some projects in Python, and I am currently learning Rust. <br><br>At this stage I am enjoying playing around with a range of languages, this website being my first real foray into html and css.
