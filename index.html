                            I have been a member of the Improvised Comedy group Stranger Things Have Happened since mid-2019. We put on live shows and workshops (although not during COVID times).

                            You can find me on GitHub. I mostly work in Java and C++, however I have also done some projects in Python, and I am currently learning Rust.
