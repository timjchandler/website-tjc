                        <p>This is a program that will allow the user to build, edit and test logical tableaux. The editor will identify inconsitencies in the tableaux and highlight them for the user. The purpose of this software is to aid in the learning and understanding of tableaux as a tool within the field of logic.<br><br>Once the system is operational and in a stable state it will be runnable via the link below.</p>

The full system and its documentation may be found on my github. <br><br>The system itself could only serve an extremely niche purpose, and is only aimed to be a proof of concept for an expert system.</p>
